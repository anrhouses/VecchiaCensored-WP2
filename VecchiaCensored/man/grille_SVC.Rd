\title{Training dataset for Spatially Varying Coefficients model}
\format{
A data frame with 400 rows and 7 columns:
\describe{
  \item{X}{X spatial coordinate (1 to 100)}
  \item{Y}{Y spatial coordinate (1 to 100)}
  \item{X1}{Transformed covariate: sqrt(|Y - 60|) with spatially varying effect}
  \item{X2}{Transformed covariate: sqrt(|X - 20|) with spatially varying effect}
  \item{Z}{True (uncensored) response variable}
  \item{censored}{Censored response variable (observations below 20th percentile are censored)}
  \item{is_censored}{Binary indicator: 1 if censored, 0 otherwise}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data for package demonstration
}
\usage{
grille_SVC
}
\description{
A simulated spatial dataset with censored observations for testing
Spatially Varying Coefficients (SVC) models where the effect of
covariates varies smoothly across space.
}
\details{
This dataset was generated with spatially varying coefficients:
\itemize{
  \item Grid: 20 x 25 locations (500 total, 400 in training set)
  \item SVC for X1: Exponential covariance with sigma² = 15, phi = 80
  \item SVC for X2: Exponential covariance with sigma² = 15, phi = 15
  \item Nugget: 0.1
  \item True model: Z = -5*X1 + 10*X2 + SVC error
  \item Censoring: ~20% of observations censored at lower tail
}
